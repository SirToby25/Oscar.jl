# Introduction

This project aims to provide functionality for what we call action polynomial rings. This phrase refers to a generalized
framework that allows for an algorithmic treatment of both difference polynomial rings and differential polynomial rings.
In the future, further similar algebraic structure might be covered as well.

## Supported features

The action polynomial rings provided in this project are implemented within [AbstractAlgebra's ring interface](@ref "Ring Interface") and come with all its [required functions](@ref "Required functions for all rings"). Also, the methods from [AbstractAlgebra's ring functionality](@ref "Ring functionality") are available for action polynomial rings.


## Status
